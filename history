Version 0.8 (2010-12-07)
-----------

* Methods

- Added the reduced-order extended Kalman filter
  ('ReducedOrderExtendedKalmanFilter').
- Added the reduced-order unscented Kalman filter
  ('ReducedOrderUnscentedKalmanFilter').
- Added the reduced minimax filter ('ReducedMinimax').
- Added support for Monte Carlo simulations ('MonteCarlo').
- Modified 'UnscentedKalmanFilter' to manage model states of type
  'VectorCollection'.

* Observations

- Improved the error management in 'LinearObservationManager'.
- Enabled reading a sparse observation operator from file in
  'LinearObservationManager'.

* Example models

- Added the model 'ParametricClampedBar'.

* Miscellaneous

- Added options to the SConstruct to provide Mumps and UMFPack compilation.
- Configured Ops so that, when an error occurs, the program throws an
  exception instead of aborting.
- Added option '%{rank}' to the Logger definition file to enable each process
  to have its own log file.

* Bug fixes

- The quadratic term was not properly computed in the method 'Forward' (and
  therefore in 'ApplyOperator' as well) of 'QuadraticModel'.
- The tangent linear model of 'QuadraticModel' was erroneous in case no
  quadratic term and no linear term were defined.
