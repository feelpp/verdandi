Version 1.0 (2011-05-27)
-----------

* Methods

- Improved the handling of the sparse and dense options in the methods:
  EKF, UKF, ROEKF and ROUKF.

* Observations

* Example models

- Added a new method 'Model::GetNfull_state()'.
- Changed the default configuration for the shallow-water model example: the
  observations are now localized at specific points instead of all grid
  points.

* Documentation

- Initial import of the documentation for the perturbation manager.

* Miscellaneous

- Improved 'GetCholesky' in the sparse case: the 'RowSparse' matrix is no
  longer converted to a dense matrix but to an 'ArrayRowSymSparse' matrix
  before the decomposition.

* Bug fixes


Version 0.9 (2011-05-12)
-----------

* Methods

- Added an implementation of the 4D-Var method ('FourDimensionalVariational').
- Redesigned the perturbation manager so that adding new generators and new
  distributions is easier, and added support for the TRNG library.
- Initial import of sequential aggregation (for ensemble forecasting) with
  discounted ridge regression.
- Improved the implementation of 'ExtendedKalmanFilter' and
  'ReducedOrderExtendedKalmanFilter'.
- Improved the consistency of 'MonteCarlo' with Verdandi.
- Initial import of the function 'ComputeBLUE_vector'.
- Added options to 'Method::Initialize' to indicate if the model or
  observation manager have to be initialized or not.
- Improved the snapshot recording so that $H^T y$ and $H^T H x$ can be
  recorded in 'ReducedMinimaxFilter'.
- Added support for a model error variance provided as a scaled identity
  matrix in 'ReducedMinimaxFilter'.
- Added the ability to save the square root of the model error variance
  in 'ReducedMinimaxFilter'.
- Changed the initialization of the assimilation methods: the constructor now
  takes no argument and the configuration file (as string or 'Ops' instance)
  is the argument of the method 'Initialize'.

* Observations

- Added the ability to define a sparse observation operator with a Lua table.

* Example models

- Added the uncertainty description for the constant term in 'QuadraticModel'.
- Removed 'ClampedBar' model, and renamed 'ParametricClampedBar' to
  'ClampedBar'.

* Documentation

- Largely improved the installation description.
- Initial import of the documentation for the example programs associated
  with the shallow-water model and the clamped-bar model.
- Added documentation on Lua configuration files.
- Added documentation for the Monte Carlo method.
- Made algorithms notation uniform in documentation.

* Miscellaneous

- Largely improved the compatibility with Visual C++.
- Added support for a user-defined dependency list in the "SConstruct".
- Extended the SWIG interface to the methods 'ForwardDriver' and
  'ReducedOrderExtendedKalmanFilter', and to the 'ClampedBar' model.
- Uniformized 'ClampedBar' example programs.

* Bug fixes

- In 'ReducedOrderExtendedKalmanFilter::Analyze()', the computation of the
  matrix 'U' was erroneous.
- The correlations between normal variables were properly handled only if they
  were equal to 0 or 1 in 'BasePerturbationManager'.
- The interpolation in 'ObservationAggregator' was erroneous.
- The tangent linear model was applied at time "h + 1"  in the method
  'PropagateCovianceMatrix()' of 'ExtendedKalmanFilter'.
- In 'ReducedOrderExtendedKalmanFilter::PropagateCovianceMatrix()', the model
  was applied at time "h + 1", but it was the tangent linear model that had
  to be applied at time "h".
- 'MessageHandler::RemoveRecipient' did not properly erase elements
  from the recipients map.
- The reduction failed when the number of snapshots was greater than
  the size of the state in 'ReducedMinimaxFilter'.
- An exception was raised when the size of the reduced state changed
  in 'ReducedMinimaxFilter'.
- In SWIG interface: the preprocessing directive 'VERDANDI_SPARSE' was defined
  in "verdandi.i" while the directive 'VERDANDI_DENSE' was defined
  in "verdandi.cpp".
- In the methods 'BasePerturbationManager::Sample' for vector collections,
  the perturbation were not deallocated.
- The time was not initialized in the constructors of 'ClampedBar'.
- Assembling Newmark matrices was erroneous in 'ClampedBar'.


Version 0.8 (2010-12-07)
-----------

* Methods

- Added the reduced-order extended Kalman filter
  ('ReducedOrderExtendedKalmanFilter').
- Added the reduced-order unscented Kalman filter
  ('ReducedOrderUnscentedKalmanFilter').
- Added the reduced minimax filter ('ReducedMinimax').
- Added support for Monte Carlo simulations ('MonteCarlo').
- Modified 'UnscentedKalmanFilter' to manage model states of type
  'VectorCollection'.

* Observations

- Improved the error management in 'LinearObservationManager'.
- Enabled reading a sparse observation operator from file in
  'LinearObservationManager'.

* Example models

- Added the model 'ParametricClampedBar'.

* Miscellaneous

- Added options to the SConstruct to provide Mumps and UMFPack compilation.
- Configured Ops so that, when an error occurs, the program throws an
  exception instead of aborting.
- Added option '%{rank}' to the Logger definition file to enable each process
  to have its own log file.

* Bug fixes

- The quadratic term was not properly computed in the method 'Forward' (and
  therefore in 'ApplyOperator' as well) of 'QuadraticModel'.
- The tangent linear model of 'QuadraticModel' was erroneous in case no
  quadratic term and no linear term were defined.
